# Medify - MVP: Drug Verification and Health Assistant App

This is the MVP of Medify, a drug verification and health assistant application. All work was done from scratch during the DaVinci Hackathon. The current version exhibits the prescription feature, allowing users to manage prescriptions efficiently. 

Upcoming updates will introduce the drug verification feature, enabling users to verify the authenticity of drugs, find pharmacies, and access other health-related functionalities.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
